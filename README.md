<!-- Brief Description -->

## Brief Description
We have created an app that allows a user to search for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink recipes that use an ingredient the user provides in the search. We wanted to create an app that helps people to see all of the drink options they have, often with ingredients they already have in their homes.

## How to use
User puts an ingredient they want to make a drink with in the search bar. They then choose the type of drinks they want (alcoholic, non-alcoholic, or both) and click 'Find Drinks' to get all the drinks that match their search. Users can click on the drink cards to get the full recipe.

Users can also click on the 'Random Drink' button to immediately see a recipe for a random drink.

## Built With
